# RHI on Bazzite / Linux

This repository now includes a native Linux desktop application for managing Windows ReShade and RenoDX components in Proton games. It runs without Wine, a system .NET installation, root access, or changes to Bazzite's immutable base image. The original Windows WinUI app remains a separate build. Both hosts reference `RHI.Core`, a platform-neutral assembly containing shared source definitions and portable helpers; `RHI.Linux.Core` retains the Linux installation, discovery and Proton adapters. See [upstream tracking and review decisions](https://github.com/TwoToneEddy/RHI/blob/linux_port/docs/LINUX-PORT-SYNC.md).

## Run

For a ready-to-run build, download **RHI-linux-x64.tar.gz** from [a Linux release](https://github.com/TwoToneEddy/RHI/releases), extract it into a permanent folder, and run `./run-linux.sh` there. Run `./install.sh` in that folder to add an application-menu entry. The package includes .NET; no SDK, compilation, or root access is needed. Keep the accompanying files together. See [release installation and updates](LINUX-RELEASE.md).

To build from source on Bazzite:

```bash
git clone --branch linux_port https://github.com/TwoToneEddy/RHI.git
cd RHI
./run-linux.sh
```

The first run downloads a user-local .NET SDK if needed, restores packages, runs tests, and builds the app. Allow several minutes and an internet connection. Later runs launch the existing build. After pulling source updates, run `./scripts/build-linux.sh` to rebuild. At the end of an interactive build, answer **Y** to add a desktop icon and application-menu entry, or **N** (the default) to skip them. Automated builds skip this prompt.

The standalone build is `artifacts/linux-x64/RHI.Linux`. The portable package and checksum are `artifacts/RHI-linux-x64.tar.gz` and `artifacts/RHI-linux-x64.tar.gz.sha256`.

To add an application-menu entry (KDE, GNOME, and other desktop-entry menus):

```bash
./scripts/install-linux-desktop.sh
```

The installer also asks whether to add a desktop icon, using your configured desktop folder. Use `--desktop` or `--no-desktop` to choose without a prompt. Some desktops require allowing the shortcut to launch on first use; desktops without icon support can use the application-menu entry.

## First game

1. Select your game from the Windows-style library sidebar. Use the search and **All Games / Installed / Favourites** filters to find it.
2. Close the game and choose **Install recommended**. RHI detects the executable and architecture, installs ReShade and the matched RenoDX addon, and applies supported UE Extended HDR settings. Installing RenoDX on its own also installs ReShade when needed.
3. If **Finish Steam setup** appears, click it. **Apply & restart Steam** saves the required launch options, retaining existing arguments and making a backup. Close other running games first. Copy/paste is available as an alternative.
4. Choose **Launch**. Let the game's shader compilation finish, confirm the menu and gameplay render correctly, and press **Home** to adjust RenoDX or enable optional ReShade effects.

The **Components** table shows green **Installed** labels when the actual managed files are present and match their recorded hashes. **Applied** means the current installed plugins appear in the last recorded game launch log. A log from before the latest plugin update does not count. **Ready to launch**, **Steam setup applied**, and **HDR settings applied** reflect setup checks, not a gameplay or display-calibration guarantee. Missing or changed plugin files show **Needs repair**.

**Nightly** is displayed beside ReShade and under **Game overrides → ReShade channel**. Click its cog or **Change**, select a channel, and choose **Apply & install** to download and install it. Changing a selection and cancelling does not change the game. A previously saved channel that differs from the installed version is explicitly marked as needing application. Nightly is the default for new games because stable 6.8.0 lacks newer Proton compatibility fixes.

The interface uses the original Windows app's logo, dark palette, component-table layout, green status colors, blue install/reinstall buttons, sidebar filters, and settings/removal buttons. **Views** toggles the optional rows for a compact component view. **Shaders/Addons** installs optional packs or custom addons for the selected game. **Update All** updates managed ReShade/RenoDX installations using each game's saved channel; local custom builds are kept.

**Advanced settings** retains executable and API selection, custom Proton prefixes, local ReShade builds, manual catalogue matching, raw launch options, and backup/recovery controls. Normal Steam setup does not require editing these. **Settings → Add Steam library** adds custom/external libraries; **+** adds a Windows executable from another launcher.

For Heroic/Lutris, add `WINEDLLOVERRIDES` as an environment variable in the launcher's per-game settings; the value for DX10/11/12 is `dxgi=n,b;d3dcompiler_47=n,b`. Keep any other existing DLL entries. Use the launcher to run the game with its existing runner/prefix.

## RE Framework (RE Engine games)

RE Engine games (detected by `re_chunk_000.pak`, shown with an **RE Engine** badge and filter) get an **RE Framework** row above ReShade, as in the Windows app. ReShade shows **RE Framework required** until it is installed, and **Install recommended** installs it first. RHI downloads the latest [REFramework nightly](https://github.com/praydog/REFramework-nightly/releases) (`REFramework.zip` → `dinput8.dll` beside the game executable), shows its build number, offers **Update RE Framework** when a newer nightly is out (also done by **Update All**), and removal restores any original `dinput8.dll`. Proton needs a native override for it, so `dinput8=n,b` is added to the game's launch options through the normal Steam setup. A copy installed by Windows RHI on a shared library is recognised and can be replaced or removed. The Windows-only PD-Upscaler build (for OptiScaler) is not included.

## Neural Rendering (DLSS 5) and DLSS overrides

The detail panel has the Windows app's **Neural Rendering** and **Nvidia Profile Overrides** sections below **Game overrides**. Click a section's title to collapse it; collapsed sections show a one-line summary.

**Neural Rendering** offers the same four methods as Windows. Inapplicable methods are disabled, and a recommended method is preselected:

| Method | Use for | Deploys |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ShortFuse DLSS Tool | Most 64-bit games with native DLSS (DX12, DX11, DX9, Vulkan) | `renodx-dlss.addon64`, the newest DLSS SR/RR/FG, the NR DLL and Streamline |
| DLSS5 Tool | DX12 games with native DLSS | `renodx-dlss5.addon64`, the newest DLSS SR/RR/FG and the NR DLL |
| DLSS5 Tool + DX11 Bridge | DX11/Vulkan games with native DLSS | as DLSS5 Tool, plus `dlss5-bridge.addon64` |
| DLSS5 Feeder | Games without native DLSS, OpenGL and 32-bit games | `dlss5-feed.addon64/32`, DLSS5 Tool as the neural consumer, DLSS SR, the NR DLL, `DLSS5_Feed.fx` and LumeniteFX's `lumenite_Kernel.fx`; for 32-bit games a `host64/` helper with 64-bit ReShade; for DX9 games dgVoodoo2 |

Choose the addon, Feeder/Bridge and NR DLL versions (or **Latest**, which **Update All** keeps current). Changing a version while installed swaps it in place. **NR Cost Scaler** (set before installing) adds the DLSS NR Cost Scaler proxy. The **⚙** beside ShortFuse writes `HookStreamline=1` and `HookDirectX=1` to ReShade.ini; the Windows ASI-loader rename is not needed on Linux (ShortFuse v0.54+ doesn't require it). RHI installs ReShade first when needed and, for the Feeder, the Standard shader pack (its shaders include `ReShade.fxh`). The Feeder's techniques are added to your existing ReShade preset rather than replacing it. For DX9 Feeder games ReShade is loaded as `dxgi.dll` behind dgVoodoo2, as on Windows. The neural model currently runs on NVIDIA RTX 50-series GPUs.

**Nvidia Profile Overrides** shows the game's DLSS Super Resolution, Ray Reconstruction, Frame Generation, Neural Rendering and Streamline DLLs, wherever they are in the game folder (including Unreal plugin folders):

- **Version** swaps a DLL: *Default* restores the game's own, a version downloads it from the same list the Windows app uses, and *Custom* uses your own file from `~/.local/share/rhi-linux/Custom/DLSS/` (or `Custom/Streamline/`). **Settings → Open custom DLSS folder** opens it.
- **Preset**, **Render Scale**, **Multi Frame Gen** and the **NVIDIA Override** version option write the same driver settings as the Windows app. Proton has no NVIDIA driver profile, so RHI passes them to dxvk-nvapi through `DXVK_NVAPI_DRS_SETTINGS` in the game's launch options. When they change, the section shows **Launch settings need updating**; **Apply launch settings** uses the normal Steam setup (existing options and your own `DXVK_NVAPI_DRS_SETTINGS` entries are kept). NVIDIA Override also sets `PROTON_ENABLE_NGX_UPDATER=1`. Managed DLSS also sets `PROTON_ENABLE_NVAPI=1`.
- **Deploy DLL / ✕** adds or removes `nvngx_dlssnr.dll`. **Quick Apply** applies your **Settings → DLSS defaults…**, which can also be applied to every installed DLSS game at once. **Restore DLSS/SL** restores every swapped DLL and resets the presets.

DLL swaps use the Windows app's `.original` convention (a real backup, or an empty marker when RHI created the file), so a library shared with Windows RHI stays consistent; Neural Rendering installed by the Windows app is recognised and can be removed here. Neural Rendering's addons and shaders are also tracked in `.rhi-linux/` with the other components, and `.rhi-linux/neural-rendering.json` records the DLLs it placed. The Windows driver-profile extras (ReBAR, Present Method and similar NVIDIA Profile Inspector settings) are not available under Proton.

## OptiScaler (Extras)

An **Extras** section below **Nvidia Profile Overrides** has the Windows app's **OptiScaler** row (64-bit games only). RHI downloads the selected version — **Stable** ([OptiScaler](https://github.com/optiscaler/OptiScaler/releases)), **Nightly** ([OptiScaler-nightly](https://github.com/optiscaler/OptiScaler-nightly/releases)) or **DLSS NR** ([the Neural Rendering fork](https://github.com/wilsjo2/OptiScaler-DLSSNR-PreSR-Multipass/releases), standard build; the opt-in RTX 40 MFG build is not used) — and installs it beside the executable as `dxgi.dll` (`winmm.dll` for Vulkan games, or another name chosen in its ⚙ settings), with its companion DLLs and backend folders, [OptiPatcher](https://github.com/optiscaler/OptiPatcher) in `plugins/`, and the newest DLSS SR/RR/FG DLLs (plus the NR DLL for DLSS NR). `OptiScaler.ini` comes from the Windows app's per-GPU templates, chosen in **Settings → OptiScaler** (GPU type, DLSS inputs for AMD/Intel, overlay hotkey); editable copies are kept in `~/.local/share/rhi-linux/inis`. `LoadReshade`, `LoadAsiPlugins` and the hotkey are always set.

When ReShade uses the same DLL name, RHI renames it to `ReShade64.dll` so OptiScaler loads it, and later ReShade updates go there; it gets its own name back when OptiScaler is removed or moved to another name. Proton needs a native override for OptiScaler's DLL name, so `dxgi=n,b` (or the chosen name) is added to the launch options through the normal Steam setup, as OptiScaler's own Linux guide recommends. On AMD RDNA3/RDNA4 with Mesa 25.2 or newer you can add `PROTON_FSR4_UPGRADE=1` for FSR 4.

The ⚙ settings match Windows: version, framerate limit and per-API upscaler; for Nightly and DLSS NR also frame generation input/output/Nvngx override/HUD fix, Streamline deployment, DLSS SR/RR presets, render scale and flip metering; Unreal Engine `Engine.ini` fixes (each restored on its own when set back to Default); DLSS NR's runtime and NR settings; and **Deploy OptiScaler.ini**. Settings are written straight to the game's `OptiScaler.ini`. Reinstalling keeps that INI, an update merges your changes into the new release's INI, and changing the version starts from the template. **Update OptiScaler** appears when a newer build of the installed version is out (also done by **Update All**). Removal restores every file OptiScaler replaced, including a pre-existing `OptiScaler.ini` and the game's own DLSS DLLs; DLSS DLLs the Neural Rendering section placed are left to it. An install made by Windows RHI on a shared library is recognised from its `rhi_install.txt` and can be replaced or removed. Not ported: DLSS Enabler (so the Nvngx "Enabler" override is disabled), the saved preset slots, the PD-Upscaler RE Framework swap, and mass deploy.

## Proton locations and HDR

Typical locations:

| Purpose | Linux location |
| --- | --- |
| Game payload | `<library>/steamapps/common/<install directory>/<executable directory>/` |
| Proton prefix | `<library>/steamapps/compatdata/<appid>/pfx/` |
| Windows LocalAppData | `<prefix>/drive_c/users/steamuser/AppData/Local/` |
| Flatpak Steam root | `~/.var/app/com.valvesoftware.Steam/.local/share/Steam/` |
| Snap Steam root | `~/snap/steam/common/.local/share/Steam/` |

Steam restart uses the client owning the library: `steam`, `flatpak run com.valvesoftware.Steam`, or `snap run steam`. The prefix may be in a different Steam library from the game. It may not exist until the first launch, and it may be overridden by your launcher. You can save an explicit prefix in the app. Game payloads use relative Windows shader paths, so they work through both native and Flatpak Steam without relying on access to RHI's cache.

For UE Extended games that require `Engine.ini`, the app finds config files **inside the game's prefix**. Select the correct file and use **RenoDX cog → Apply recommended HDR settings** (also available in Advanced settings). This preserves existing ray-tracing/FSR and other keys and backs up the settings it changes. The recipe enables the Unreal HDR output path and real-time LUT updates; it also selects `Set_Path=0` in ReShade's RenoDX configuration. The game can rewrite Engine.ini at launch, so RHI marks this file read-only as required by the wiki. The dedicated restore button restores the original permissions as well as the keys. These tweaks are not recommended for UE4 games; follow the game's wiki instructions.

HDR must also be enabled and supported by your display, compositor and Proton runtime. RHI does not change desktop display settings or force a particular Proton version. Bazzite desktop/Gamescope setup can differ; see the sources below. ReShade loading successfully is separate from confirming your display's HDR output and calibrating it.

For the installed **Mortal Shell II** test case, Steam calls the game folder `Sparta`, but the rendering executable is `MortalShell2/Binaries/Win64/MortalShell2-Win64-Shipping.exe`. Its app ID is `2584270`, and its UE config is under `MortalShell2/Saved/Config/Windows` inside that app's prefix. The wiki lists the game under **UE Extended**, with an `Engine.ini` requirement.

## Backups and removal

- Plugin ownership, SHA-256 hashes, original files and transaction snapshots are in `.rhi-linux/` beside the chosen executable. Keep this directory to preserve uninstall/restore support.
- Existing unmanaged plugin files require the explicit backup-and-replace checkbox. A DLL modified after RHI installed it is preserved and reported as a conflict.
- Updates keep the original pre-RHI backup. Interrupted transactions are recovered before the next install/remove. Removing a component restores its original files. Edited ReShade settings are preserved.
- HDR INI recovery records are in `~/.local/share/rhi-linux/ini-backups/` (or `$XDG_DATA_HOME/rhi-linux/ini-backups`). Restore undoes only RHI's keys and preserves subsequent unrelated edits.
- Removing RenoDX or all managed components also restores HDR INI edits for the selected game. Remove the injected DLL override from your Steam/launcher launch options afterwards.
- Downloads/cache: `~/.cache/rhi-linux/`. Preferences and logs: `~/.local/share/rhi-linux/`. XDG overrides are respected. Clearing downloads does not delete game-local plugin backups.

## Linux support boundaries

Supported: native Steam, Flatpak Steam and Snap Steam library scanning; manual games; ReShade stable/nightly/local; live/cached RenoDX catalogue; named and shared addons; shader packs; local addons; API/architecture selection; Proton launch options; UE Extended prefix configuration; component updates and reversible removal.

Also supported: RE Framework for RE Engine games, OptiScaler (Stable, Nightly and DLSS NR), Neural Rendering (all four DLSS 5 methods, Cost Scaler), DLSS/Streamline version swaps, and DLSS presets/render scale/Multi Frame Gen/NVIDIA Override through dxvk-nvapi.

This is not full Windows feature parity. Windows-only NVIDIA driver profile settings (ReBAR, Present Method), Windows HDR toggles, Windows global Vulkan layers, automatic detection of every non-Steam launcher and Luma workflows are not ported. Native Linux Vulkan games have only the opt-in [experimental Native Vulkan ReShade backend](#native-vulkan-reshade-experimental); RenoDX is not available for them. Addon compatibility and anti-cheat policies remain game-specific. Choose games that allow DLL modding.

## Build and validation

```bash
./scripts/build-linux.sh
./run-linux.sh --scan
./run-linux.sh --catalog-check
./run-linux.sh --smoke-test
./run-linux.sh --nr-smoke-test
./run-linux.sh --os-smoke-test
./run-linux.sh --native-reshade-smoke-test
```

The build script uses an installed .NET SDK or installs the version pinned in `scripts/linux-dependencies.env` in the user's data directory, runs Linux unit/integration tests, and publishes a self-contained Linux **x86_64** build. ARM64/Asahi and 32-bit Linux hosts are not supported by this package. Windows game payloads can still be 32-bit where the component supports them.

Portable packages include .NET and the official static 7-Zip extractor. The build verifies the extractor archive against the SHA-256 pinned in `scripts/linux-dependencies.env`; its version, checksum, source-code URL and redistribution notices are included in `BUILD-INFO.txt` and `licenses/7zip/`. End users do not need system `7z`, Python, a .NET SDK or root access. The menu installer uses Bash. A direct developer `dotnet run` without a packaged extractor can use a system `7zz`/`7z` instead.

The desktop still needs X11 (or XWayland in a Wayland session), fontconfig and .NET's native libraries. These are normally present on gaming desktops. Minimal installs may need the packages below, in addition to their normal glibc/GCC runtimes, certificates and zlib:

| Distribution | Native desktop/runtime prerequisites | Source-build additions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bazzite / Fedora Atomic desktops | Use the existing desktop libraries; run the portable package from your home directory. No base-image modification is needed. | `git`, `curl`, `tar`, `gzip`, `xz`, Bash; Python 3 for tooling/package tests. |
| Fedora Workstation / Fedora container | `libX11 libICE libSM fontconfig libicu openssl-libs krb5-libs`; XWayland for a Wayland desktop. | `git curl tar gzip xz python3`; the build installs its SDK in user space if needed. |
| Debian / Ubuntu desktop | `libx11-6 libice6 libsm6 libfontconfig1 libgssapi-krb5-2`; the release's ICU/OpenSSL packages and XWayland when applicable. | `git curl tar gzip xz-utils python3`. |
| Arch desktop | `libx11 libice libsm fontconfig icu openssl krb5`; XWayland when applicable. Keep the system's runtime packages updated together. | `git curl tar gzip xz python`; no global .NET SDK is required. |
| Steam Deck / SteamOS | Use Desktop Mode and extract the portable x86_64 package under your home directory. Keep the system read-only. | Build on a development machine/container, then copy the whole package to the Deck. |

Package names for versioned ICU/OpenSSL libraries vary by release. Consult the [.NET 8 native dependency list](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/8.0/linux-packages.md), [Fedora dependency guidance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/linux-fedora#dependencies), and [Avalonia desktop Linux requirements](https://docs.avaloniaui.net/docs/platform-specific-guides/linux). Fedora and Ubuntu CI exercise headless tests and relocated packages; graphical gameplay/HDR behavior still requires testing on the target desktop. The first source build needs network access for NuGet and the pinned extractor.

For upstream maintenance, also run `python3 scripts/check-upstream-sync.py` and `python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts/tests -v`. [LINUX-PORT-SYNC.md](https://github.com/TwoToneEddy/RHI/blob/linux_port/docs/LINUX-PORT-SYNC.md) documents the full source map, remaining feature gaps and explicit review procedure.

`--scan` is read-only and prints detected paths as JSON. `--smoke-test` downloads real x86/x64 ReShade, a real RenoDX addon, shader packs and the RE Framework nightly, then checks install/update/remove and original restoration **in an isolated temporary folder**, plus the nightly x64 download. It never installs into detected games. `--nr-smoke-test` downloads the real Neural Rendering components and, in disposable game folders, installs each method (including 32-bit and DX9 Feeder), checks the status, launch settings and an in-place version swap, then verifies removal restores every original file. `--native-reshade-smoke-test` downloads the pinned experimental Native Vulkan ReShade release, verifies its checksum and opt-in layer manifest, and installs, reinstalls and removes it in a temporary prefix (never `~/.local`), checking that an existing shader is preserved and no optional add-on is installed. `--os-smoke-test` downloads the real OptiScaler Stable, Nightly and DLSS NR builds and, beside a ReShade install in disposable game folders, checks the ReShade64.dll rename, INI, OptiPatcher, DLSS DLLs, Streamline, a reinstall that keeps INI changes, and exact removal. Headless UI tests exercise installed/applied indicators, filtering, and the ReShade channel dialog against isolated game folders. Unit tests cover stale launch logs, changed payloads, launch-readiness checks, flatpak/external libraries, symlink deduplication, casing, malformed manifests, PE architecture rejection, safe launch-option merges, interrupted transactions, file conflicts, and INI restoration.

The original Windows solution requires its Windows build environment; use `RHI.Linux.sln` or the Linux build script on Bazzite. The GUI uses Avalonia with software rendering to avoid depending on the game's graphics stack.

The command `./run-linux.sh --prepare APPID --ue-hdr --nightly` can prepare a matching UE Extended Steam game directly; omit `--ue-hdr` for other named mods. Without `--nightly`, preparation uses the game's saved ReShade channel (Nightly for new entries). This command writes game files. Use `--save-launch-options APPID` after exiting Steam to persist the required DLL overrides.

## Creating Linux releases

The **Linux build and release** GitHub Actions workflow builds/tests on Ubuntu and Fedora, checks the extracted package and menu installer, builds/tests the Windows host against the shared core, and uploads a downloadable Linux build artifact on pushes and pull requests to `linux_port`, `main`, and `master`. It also supports **Run workflow** once the workflow exists on the repository's default branch.

To prepare a release, commit the changes and push a unique Linux tag pointing at the version you want to ship, for example:

```bash
git tag -a linux-v0.1.0 -m 'Linux preview 0.1.0'
git push origin linux-v0.1.0
```

When that tag's build and package checks pass, the workflow creates a **draft prerelease** with the archive, SHA-256 checksum, and installation instructions attached. Open **Releases** on GitHub, review the draft, and publish it. Linux tags are separate from Windows version tags. GitHub Actions must be enabled and permitted to write repository contents for the release job.

You can also prepare and verify the same files locally, then attach them to a release yourself:

```bash
./scripts/build-linux.sh
./scripts/check-linux-package.sh
```

The application, .NET runtime and static 7-Zip extractor are bundled; ReShade, RenoDX, and shader packs are downloaded when users install them. `BUILD-INFO.txt` in the archive records the source commit and SDK. The Linux release remains a preview with the support boundaries described above.

## Black screen with an accessible ReShade overlay

On the tested GE-Proton11-6 setup, stable ReShade 6.8.0 caused a black screen in Mortal Shell II even with RenoDX disabled. ReShade nightly from September 12, 2026 restored the menu background. With RenoDX UE Extended and the native HDR recipe re-enabled, the user also confirmed normal gameplay without cursor trails or a black background. Its newer VKD3D interface hooks include an upstream compatibility fix absent from 6.8.0. Select **Nightly** in RHI and install/update ReShade before changing game graphics settings.

To undo RHI's HDR edits with the game closed, use **RenoDX cog → Restore previous HDR settings** or `./run-linux.sh --restore-hdr 2584270`. This also restores Engine.ini's original file permissions. Removal controls can restore the pre-install plugin files for a baseline test. Keep gameplay validation separate from the isolated download/install smoke test.

## Native HDR on the game page

Use **Native HDR → Enable Native HDR** on the main game page for games with built-in HDR. This saves both `PROTON_ENABLE_WAYLAND=1` and `PROTON_ENABLE_HDR=1` for the selected Steam account, with a backup, and offers to restart Steam if needed. No ReShade or RenoDX installation is required. Enable HDR in the game and display settings and use a compatible Proton build.

The button turns green when the saved launch options contain unambiguous enabled HDR and Wayland flags. This means **configured**, not verified HDR output. **Disable** removes only that flag, preserving current DLL overrides, DLSS options, Wayland, HDR WSI and game arguments. Conflicting or ambiguous options must be resolved manually. The state is refreshed when returning to RHI.

The cog opens the optional Wayland / HDR WSI preview helper. For games without an available Steam account configuration, the main button opens that helper so you can copy options into your launcher.

## RE Engine Wine detection bypass

RE Engine games show an optional **RE Engine Wine detection → Bypass Wine detection** control beside the Native HDR section. It reuses the same `IsREEngine` detection as the RE Framework row; no additional engine detection is performed. Nothing is enabled automatically.

Enabling appends `/WineDetectionEnabled:False` after `%command%` for the selected Steam account, using the existing backup and Steam restart flow. Disabling removes only that argument, preserving HDR, DLL overrides and other launch options. Conflicting values or ambiguous syntax require manual review. For games without an available Steam account configuration, a preview helper lets you paste, edit and copy launcher options.

This RE Engine workaround may expose ray-tracing options in supported games; enable ray tracing in-game afterwards. It does not add ray-tracing support to games or hardware. Compatibility varies, and [game/driver crashes have been reported with the argument](https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/issues/2884); disable the bypass if it causes problems.

## HDR launch-option preview

Open **RenoDX HDR settings → HDR launch options…**, or **Advanced settings → Proton launch options → HDR launch options…** for the selected game. Select the Steam account if needed. For another launcher, or if Steam has unsaved changes, paste the complete current launch options into the input first.

The preset adds `PROTON_ENABLE_HDR=1`, with separate choices for `PROTON_ENABLE_WAYLAND=1` (selected initially) and `ENABLE_HDR_WSI=1` (optional). Check support in your Proton build and display setup: [GE-Proton documents the Proton switches](https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/blob/master/README.md), and [VK_hdr_layer documents HDR WSI](https://github.com/Zamundaaa/VK_hdr_layer). These settings do not confirm that the game is outputting HDR.

Choose **Preview HDR options**, review the result, then **Copy preview** and paste it into Steam's game Properties → General → Launch Options. This tool does not write to Steam or persist a preset that could later overwrite another feature's settings. Reopen it after changing ReShade, DLSS or other launch options to read their latest values.

The merge only prefixes missing selected variables. Existing DLL overrides, DLSS variables, wrapper arguments, spacing and game arguments remain intact. Already enabled literal values are kept, and unchecked variables are left alone. Conflicting values, duplicate selected variables, ambiguous variable placement, environment wrappers and shell scripting are refused rather than rewritten. Resolve those manually in your launcher. **Restore original preview** shows the input without the preset additions; use **Copy preview** to undo only if no subsequent launcher changes need to be preserved. The original input remains available while the dialog is open.

## Native Vulkan ReShade (experimental)

**Experimental and off by default.** Every game keeps the Windows ReShade backend through Proton unless you select this backend for it. Existing settings are unchanged.

RHI can manage the community [native Linux/Vulkan ReShade port](https://github.com/TheForgotten69/reshade/tree/linux-vulkan) for **native x86-64 Linux games that render with Vulkan**. It is an opt-in Vulkan layer, not a Windows DLL, and it:

- does **not** load Windows RenoDX mods or other Windows `.addon64` files, so it does not provide RenoDX HDR. Native Linux RenoDX builds do not exist yet;
- does not support OpenGL, 32-bit or non-x86-64 games;
- is not used for Proton games in this release. Upstream documents experimental Proton hosting, but RHI keeps Windows ReShade for Proton until that is validated separately.

### Setup

1. **Advanced settings → ReShade backend → Native Vulkan ReShade (experimental)** for a Steam game, or **Add native Linux game (experimental)…** for another game. RHI refuses the switch while it has Windows ReShade installed for that game; remove it first (RHI never deletes it automatically).
2. **Choose native Linux executable…** and select the game binary. RHI checks its ELF header, program-table bounds, executable entry point and execute permissions: it must be an x86-64 executable inside the game folder. Launch scripts, Windows `.exe` files, shared libraries, other architectures and malformed files are refused. Detection is manual: an ELF file does not prove what Steam launches or which graphics API is used.
3. Tick **This game renders with Vulkan**. RHI does not guess the API.
4. On the main game page, **Install runtime**. RHI downloads the pinned release `v6.8.0-beta.3` (`reshade-linux-vulkan-v6.8.0-beta.3-x86_64.tar.xz`, SHA-256 `c880b38cd467be738f0f11fd2508db748c1c13a94935540cfafcdd0a8efd894b`) from the port's GitHub releases, validates the archive paths, host library architecture and layer manifest, and never runs the archive's `install.sh`.
5. **Enable for this game** saves `RESHADE_ENABLE=1` before `%command%` for the selected Steam account, using the usual backup and Steam restart. For other launchers, **Preview…** lets you paste, preview and copy launch options, or set the `RESHADE_ENABLE=1` environment variable for that game yourself. No Proton flags are added.
6. Launch the game and press **Home** to open ReShade.

While the native backend is selected, the game page hides Windows ReShade, RenoDX, shader packs, RE Framework, Native HDR/Wayland, RE Engine, Neural Rendering, DLSS/NVIDIA overrides and OptiScaler. **Update All**, **Install recommended**, DLSS **Apply to all** and the Shaders/Addons dialog skip it. Windows ReShade setup is refused for launch options containing `RESHADE_ENABLE`, so the two backends are not enabled together.

### What is installed

The runtime is shared by all native games for your user, following the release layout:

| File | Location |
| --- | --- |
| Host library | `~/.local/lib/reshade/ReShade64.so` |
| Vulkan implicit layer (`VK_LAYER_reshade`) | `~/.local/share/vulkan/implicit_layer.d/ReShade64.json` |
| Standard shaders | `~/.local/share/reshade/reshade-shaders/` |

Locations follow `$XDG_DATA_HOME` (the library is at `$XDG_DATA_HOME/../lib/reshade`). The layer is only active in processes started with `RESHADE_ENABLE=1`; `DISABLE_RESHADE=1` overrides it. Ownership, hashes and transaction records are in `~/.local/share/rhi-linux/native-reshade/`, with the release's `LICENSE.md` (BSD 3-clause). Optional example add-ons in the archive are never installed.

Shaders are seeded: files that already exist, including your edits and other shader packs, are never replaced, including on reinstall. To add a shader pack, copy its `.fx`/`.fxh` files to `reshade-shaders/Shaders` and textures to `reshade-shaders/Textures`. Only native Linux `.addon`/`.addon64` modules load, from `~/.local/share/reshade`.

If another ReShade Vulkan layer is found (for example one you built or installed with the port's own installer, in your home directory or system layer folders), RHI shows it as **user-managed**, uses it as-is for activation, and does not install over, update or remove it.

### Status

- **Runtime:** installed files are verified against their recorded hashes; changed or missing files show **Needs repair**.
- **Launch:** green only when the saved Steam launch options contain an unambiguous `RESHADE_ENABLE=1`. This means configured, not loaded.
- **Last launch:** shown only when a ReShade log under `~/.local/share/reshade/logs/` records the layer initialising in the selected executable after the runtime was installed. It does not prove that effects render correctly.

### Configuration and presets

ReShade itself chooses the configuration. Each game gets `~/.local/share/reshade/configurations/{profile}/ReShade.ini`, with its preset beside it; Steam games use the install folder and app ID as the profile, other native applications the name they report to Vulkan or the executable name. A `ReShade.ini` next to the native executable is used in place instead, so RHI warns when one exists (for example, from a Windows ReShade installation in the same folder). RHI does not set `RESHADE_PROFILE`; add it to your launch options yourself to choose a profile. Presets made for Windows ReShade may reference effects or add-ons that are unavailable; test each game.

### Disable, uninstall and recovery

- **Disable** removes only `RESHADE_ENABLE=1`, keeping HDR, wrappers, game arguments and DLL overrides. Conflicting values (`RESHADE_ENABLE=0`, duplicates, the variable after `%command%` or inside a wrapper), `DISABLE_RESHADE`, `env -i` wrappers and shell syntax are refused rather than rewritten.
- To stop using the backend for a game, disable it on the game page, then choose the default backend in Advanced settings. RHI refuses the switch while `RESHADE_ENABLE` remains in that game's Steam launch options.
- **Settings → Native Vulkan ReShade runtime… → Remove shared runtime** remains available after switching the last game away from the native backend. Removal is refused while any game still uses the native backend. It removes only runtime and shader files RHI installed and that are unchanged. Configurations, presets, logs, add-ons and edited shaders are kept. A runtime file changed outside RHI is preserved and reported.
- Interrupted installs and removals are rolled back from the transaction journal when RHI next checks the runtime or installs/removes it, before checking ownership. **Reinstall** restores missing files. If a runtime file has changed, RHI reports its path and preserves it; move it aside before reinstalling.

### Limitations and testing status

- The Flatpak and Snap Steam clients run games in sandboxes that cannot see layers in your home directory. The backend is refused for games from those clients; it supports the native Steam client and host launchers only.
- Native Steam games that run inside the Steam Linux Runtime container have not been validated. The host library needs Wayland, xkbcommon, XCB (xinput, xfixes, cursor, shape) and Fontconfig libraries, which may not all be available in the container.
- Automated tests use temporary folders and synthetic packages. The real pinned release was checked with `--native-reshade-smoke-test`, and the installed layout loaded into `vulkaninfo` only with `RESHADE_ENABLE=1` (not with `DISABLE_RESHADE=1`). No game, overlay, input, shader compilation, preset persistence or multi-game configuration test has been performed through RHI yet; report results with your distribution, desktop session, GPU driver and game.
- Automatic native/Proton detection is not implemented. A manual override and explicit Vulkan confirmation are required.

Native Vulkan setup is also available from the **ReShade cog** beside its install button: select the backend, choose the native executable and confirm Vulkan. Games without a Windows executable show **Set up ReShade…** and the cog. The native runtime row retains the cog so you can change backends later. Advanced settings provides the same backend controls.
